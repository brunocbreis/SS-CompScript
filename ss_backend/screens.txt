from .classes import Screen
from. resolve_api import Tool

# self.screens:
{
    1: {
        "screen": Screen, -> doesn't change, will have attributes that inform others recomputed after user interaction
        "tools": set[Tool, Tool, Tool], -> don't change, but can have attributes set
        "rectangle": int, -> the id of the canvas item, will be changed at every redraw
    }
}

or... (i think this is worse)

{
    Screen: {
        "id": 1,
        "tools": set[Tool, Tool, Tool],
        "rectangle": int,
    }
}


# the name can be easily created by f stringing SSScreen and the key
# the key creation starts at 1 and uses the find_missing method to see what media in i'm supposed to create
